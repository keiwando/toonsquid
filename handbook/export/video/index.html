<h1>Video</h1><p>Video formats are the most natural export option for your animations. They are also the only options that allow you to include audio in your export.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/hb/export/video.jpg" alt="Video export screen"></p>
<h2 id="file-formats" class="heading-with-anchor">Available File Formats <!-- anchor: file-formats --><a href="#file-formats" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h2><p>You can export your ToonSquid animations as videos in the following formats</p>
<ul>
<li>MP4</li>
<li>MOV</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="settings" class="heading-with-anchor">Settings <!-- anchor: settings --><a href="#settings" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h2><h3 id="name" class="heading-with-anchor">Name <!-- anchor: name --><a href="#name" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>This will be the name of the exported video file.</p>
<h3 id="range" class="heading-with-anchor">Range <!-- anchor: range --><a href="#range" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>Controls which part of your timeline should be exported.</p>
<h4 id="range-current-clip" class="heading-with-anchor">Current clip <!-- anchor: range-current-clip --><a href="#range-current-clip" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h4><p>Only frames from the clip or scene currently selected in the editor should be exported.</p>
<h4 id="range-all-scenes" class="heading-with-anchor">All scenes <!-- anchor: range-all-scenes --><a href="#range-all-scenes" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h4><p>Every <a href="/handbook/projects/scenes">scene</a> of the current project should be exported as one video.</p>
<h3 id="range-first-last-frame" class="heading-with-anchor">First frame / Last frame <!-- anchor: range-first-last-frame --><a href="#range-first-last-frame" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>The range of frames to be exported.</p>
<h3 id="resolution" class="heading-with-anchor">Resolution <!-- anchor: resolution --><a href="#resolution" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>The resolution of the exported video. Choosing a different value here will simply scale the export and not crop anything. Changing the resolution disproportionately will therefore stretch the animation in the final export.</p>
<h4 id="keep-aspect" class="heading-with-anchor">Keep aspect ratio <!-- anchor: keep-aspect --><a href="#keep-aspect" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h4><p>Whether changing the resolution&#39;s width or height should also update the other value proportionally to keep the current resolution&#39;s aspect ratio.</p>
<h3 id="fps" class="heading-with-anchor">Fps <!-- anchor: fps --><a href="#fps" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>The <a href="/handbook/projects/create_project#fps">frame rate</a> of the exported video.<br/>Choosing a different frame rate here will not cause the animation to be slowed down or sped up in the export. The animation will be re-sampled to match the desired output resolution.</p>
<h3 id="include-audio" class="heading-with-anchor">Include audio <!-- anchor: include-audio --><a href="#include-audio" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>Whether any audio should be included in the exported video. This option is only shown if there is an audio layer in the animation.</p>
<h3 id="include-transparency" class="heading-with-anchor">Include transparency <!-- anchor: include-transparency --><a href="#include-transparency" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>Whether the exported video should include transparency information for each pixel using the H.265 (HEVC) codec. This is currently only supported for the MOV file type.</p>
<h3 id="reset" class="heading-with-anchor">Reset <!-- anchor: reset --><a href="#reset" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>Use this button to reset all settings back to their defaults.</p>
<h2 id="preview" class="heading-with-anchor">Preview <!-- anchor: preview --><a href="#preview" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h2><p>You can use the frame slider under the preview on the right to preview the range of the animation that will be exported.</p>
