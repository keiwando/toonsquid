<h1>Manage Projects</h1><p>The project library is the first screen you see when you open ToonSquid. This is where you manage all of your ToonSquid projects. </p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/hb/projects/library.jpg" alt="Project library"></p>
<p>The project library uses the general structure of the <a href="/handbook/interface/library">library interface</a>.</p>
<p>To create a new project, tap the <code>+</code> button in the top right corner. The exact steps for this are explained <a href="/handbook/projects/create_project">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="import" class="heading-with-anchor">Import <!-- anchor: import --><a href="#import" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Use the <code>Import</code> button in the toolbar to select and import a project file with the <code>.tsproj</code> extension into your project library.</p>
<h2 id="export" class="heading-with-anchor">Export <!-- anchor: export --><a href="#export" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h2><p>You can export your projects either directly from the project library, or via the export interface of the editor. Follow the steps described on the <a href="/handbook/interface/library">library interface</a> page to <a href="/handbook/interface/library#select">select</a> and <a href="/handbook/interface/library#action-export">export</a> the selected project. </p>
<p>The resulting file will have a <code>.tsproj</code> extension, indicating that it is a ToonSquid animation project.</p>
<h2>Help</h2><p>In addition to the other library toolbar buttons, a <a href="/handbook/interface/editor#help">help</a> button is also shown in the project library so that you can quickly access support resources if needed from the very first screen of the app.</p>
