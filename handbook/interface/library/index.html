    document.toonsquid_content = `<h4><a href="/handbook/interface/overview">Interface</a></h4><!--- tags: library, search, assets, manage, organize, import -->

<h1>Library</h1><p>The library interface is used in multiple places across ToonSquid. You&#39;ll use it to organize projects, assets such as <a href="/handbook/symbols/animation_clips">animation clips</a>, <a href="/handbook/layers/audio">audio</a> and <a href="/handbook/layers/video">video clips</a> and brush textures.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/hb/interface/library.jpg" alt="Library"></p>
<p>The different occurrences of the library behave very similarly with the exception that not all buttons are available everywhere.</p>
<p>This interface shows the items within a library with their name, commonly a thumbnail and some additional information, such as the resolution and frame rate of a project.</p>
<h2 id="tabs" class="heading-with-anchor">Tabs <!-- anchor: tabs --><a href="#tabs" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h2><p>If the library contains different types of content such as animation, video and audio clips, you can select which type should be visible with the tabs at the top.</p>
<h2 id="add" class="heading-with-anchor">Add Content <!-- anchor: add --><a href="#add" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Tap the <code>+</code> button in the top right corner to add more content to the library. Other pages cover the process of <a href="/handbook/symbols/create_symbol#create-in-library">creating new animation clips</a>, <a href="/handbook/projects/create_project">creating new projects</a> and importing <a href="/handbook/layers/video#import">video clips</a> and <a href="/handbook/layers/audio#import">audio clips</a> in detail.</p>
<h2 id="search" class="heading-with-anchor">Search <!-- anchor: search --><a href="#search" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Use the search bar above the contents of the library to quickly find the items that you are looking for. This searches the items based on their name.</p>
<p>Use the small cross icon to clear the search and see all items in the library again.</p>
<h2 id="sort" class="heading-with-anchor">Sort <!-- anchor: sort --><a href="#sort" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Use the <code>Sort by</code> button to change the order of the items in the library. You can sort them by name and by their last modified date.</p>
<h2 id="rename" class="heading-with-anchor">Rename <!-- anchor: rename --><a href="#rename" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Tap the name of an item in the library to start editing it. When you are done, dismiss the keyboard or tap outside the name label.</p>
<h2 id="select" class="heading-with-anchor">Select <!-- anchor: select --><a href="#select" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h2><p>You can switch into selection mode by either long-pressing on an item or by using the <code>Select</code> button.<br/>Use the <code>Done</code> button (which replaces the <code>Select</code> button) to exit the selection mode once you are done.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/hb/interface/library_selection_mode.jpg" alt="Library"></p>
<p>In the selection mode, you can tap individual items to add or remove them from the selection.</p>
<p>A toolbar at the bottom of the library shows the available options for the current selection of items. Some options are only available if exactly one item is selected.</p>
<h3 id="action-insert" class="heading-with-anchor">Insert <!-- anchor: action-insert --><a href="#action-insert" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>Inserts the selected animation clip, video clip or audio clip into the current animation timeline.</p>
<p>This is the default behavior of tapping an item in the asset library outside of the selection mode.</p>
<h3 id="action-edit" class="heading-with-anchor">Edit <!-- anchor: action-edit --><a href="#action-edit" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>Opens the selected project or animation clip to be edited in the editor.</p>
<h3 id="action-rename" class="heading-with-anchor">Rename <!-- anchor: action-rename --><a href="#action-rename" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>Prompts the item to be <a href="/handbook/interface/library#rename">renamed</a>.</p>
<h3 id="action-export" class="heading-with-anchor">Export <!-- anchor: action-export --><a href="#action-export" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>If the selected item is a project, the project is exported and a screen is opened for you to choose a location to save it.</p>
<p>If the selected item is an <a href="/handbook/symbols/animation_clips">animation clip</a>, the <a href="/handbook/export/overview">export interface</a> is opened to export the selected clip.</p>
<h3 id="action-duplicate" class="heading-with-anchor">Duplicate <!-- anchor: action-duplicate --><a href="#action-duplicate" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>Duplicates the item in the library.</p>
<h3 id="action-delete" class="heading-with-anchor">Delete <!-- anchor: action-delete --><a href="#action-delete" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>Deletes the item from the library.</p>
<p>Deleting assets (animation clips, videos, audio clips) from the asset library is undoable. However, deleting projects is not undoable, so consider creating a backup of your projects before you delete them.</p>
