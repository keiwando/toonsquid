    document.toonsquid_content = `<h4><a href="/handbook/symbols/overview">Symbols</a></h4><!--- tags: clips, scenes, symbols, movie clip, animation, reuse, library -->

<h1>Symbol Layer</h1><p>A symbol layer references an <a href="/handbook/symbols/animation_clips">animation clip</a> in the project asset library and shows the contents of that clip as its own content. The referenced clip will also play back over time inside the symbol layer.</p>
<p>Symbol layers have a <a href="/handbook/transform/transform_properties">transform</a> that can be used to position, rotate and scale the referenced clip just like any other layer. </p>
<p>Symbol layers use the <code>Pass Through</code> <a href="/handbook/layers/blend_modes#passthrough">blend mode</a> by default, which results in the same appearance as if the layers of the referenced were directly in the timeline instead of the symbol layer.</p>
<h2 id="properties" class="heading-with-anchor">Properties <!-- anchor: properties --><a href="#properties" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h2><p><img src="/assets/images/hb/symbols/properties.jpg" alt="Symbol layer properties"></p>
<h3 id="clip" class="heading-with-anchor">Clip <!-- anchor: clip --><a href="#clip" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>The <a href="/handbook/symbols/animation_clips">animation clip</a> whose contents should be played back in the symbol layer. You can select any animation clip from the library.</p>
<h3 id="loop-mode" class="heading-with-anchor">Loop Mode <!-- anchor: loop-mode --><a href="#loop-mode" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>The loop mode controls the playback of the animation clip if the symbol layer is longer than the referenced animation. </p>
<h4 id="loop-mode-dont-loop" class="heading-with-anchor">Don&#39;t loop <!-- anchor: loop-mode-dont-loop --><a href="#loop-mode-dont-loop" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h4><p>No looping takes place. Once the animation clip runs out of content, the symbol layer will appear empty.</p>
<h4 id="loop-mode-normal" class="heading-with-anchor">Normal <!-- anchor: loop-mode-normal --><a href="#loop-mode-normal" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h4><p>The referenced animation clip will play again from the beginning once it reaches its last frame. This is the default loop mode.</p>
<h4 id="boomerang" class="heading-with-anchor">Boomerang <!-- anchor: boomerang --><a href="#boomerang" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h4><p>The clip is first played forwards until its last frame is reached. It is then played in reverse until the first frame and then the loop starts again.</p>
<h3 id="use-own-fps" class="heading-with-anchor">Use own frame rate <!-- anchor: use-own-fps --><a href="#use-own-fps" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>This setting is only relevant if the clip that the symbol layer is in and the referenced symbol animation clip have different frame rates.</p>
<p>It defines whether the symbol should play back at the frame rate of its own referenced clip or the timeline that it&#39;s currently in.</p>
<p>Note that audio is automatically muted if it&#39;s coming through a symbol that is not playing back at its own frame rate.</p>
<h4>Example: Importing a 60fps video into a 30fps timeline via a symbol</h4><p>If <code>Use own frame rate</code> is enabled, the video plays back in real-time (every second frame is skipped to maintain its natural speed).</p>
<p>If <code>Use own frame rate</code> is disabled, the video plays back at half-speed (no frames are skipped - one frame in the timeline equals one frame in the symbol clip (i.e. video)).</p>
<h3 id="time" class="heading-with-anchor">Time <!-- anchor: time --><a href="#time" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>The frame of the referenced clip at which the playback in the symbol should begin. This works similarly to the <code>Offset</code> property of an <a href="/handbook/layers/audio#offset">audio clip</a>.</p>
<h3 id="muted" class="heading-with-anchor">Muted <!-- anchor: muted --><a href="#muted" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>Whether audio layers should play through this symbol.</p>
<h2 id="camera" class="heading-with-anchor">Camera Behavior <!-- anchor: camera --><a href="#camera" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h2><p>If the referenced clip has a <a href="/handbook/layers/camera">camera layer</a>, the resolution of that camera defines the resolution in which the clip is displayed in its symbols.</p>
<blockquote>
<h4 id="tip-double-tap-edit-symbol" class="heading-with-anchor">Tip <!-- anchor: tip-double-tap-edit-symbol --><a href="#tip-double-tap-edit-symbol" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h4><p>When a symbol layer is selected in the transform tool, double tap it to open the referenced clip in the editor.</p>
