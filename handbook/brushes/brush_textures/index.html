<h1>Brush Textures</h1><p>ToonSquid brushes use a <a href="/handbook/brushes/brush_settings#shape">shape</a> and a <a href="/handbook/brushes/brush_settings#grain">grain</a> texture to generate the brush strokes while you draw. You can select the textures that you want your brush to use from the brush texture library via the <a href="/handbook/brushes/brush_editor">brush editor</a>.</p>
<h2 id="library" class="heading-with-anchor">Library <!-- anchor: library --><a href="#library" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h2><p><img src="/assets/images/hb/brushes/texture_library.jpg" alt="Brush texture library"></p>
<p>The brush texture <a href="/handbook/interface/library">library interface</a> has a tab for shape textures and a tab for grain textures, but you can choose from either of these tabs when selecting a texture for your brush shape and grain. </p>
<p>Shape textures typically contain shapes that don&#39;t extend to the edges of the image, since they form the basis of the shape of the brush stroke. Grain textures on the other hand are mostly used to add more variation and to simulate surface textures. Therefore, most of them fill the entire image and are seamlessly repeating.</p>
<h2 id="import" class="heading-with-anchor">Import <!-- anchor: import --><a href="#import" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h2><p>ToonSquid already comes with numerous shape and grain textures that you can use to create hundreds of different brushes, but you can also add your own custom brush textures by importing more images into the brush texture library.</p>
<ol>
<li>Tap the <code>+</code> button in the top right corner.</li>
<li>Choose <code>Import from Photos</code> or <code>Import from Files</code>.</li>
<li>Select the image you want to use as a brush texture in order to copy it into the currently selected tab of the texture library.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="grayscale" class="heading-with-anchor">Grayscale <!-- anchor: grayscale --><a href="#grayscale" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>All brush textures are grayscale images since they only control the shape of a brush stroke and not its colors. The amount of white at each pixel determines where the brush will apply paint onto the layer.</p>
<p>If you import a grayscale image, it is used as-is. If you import an RGB image, it is converted to grayscale based on the brightness of each pixel. Importing an image with transparencies will only use the alpha channel as the grayscale pixels of the new brush texture. The colors are completely ignored in this case.</p>
