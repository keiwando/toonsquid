<h1>Brush Settings</h1><h2 id="stroke-category" class="heading-with-anchor">Stroke <!-- anchor: stroke-category --><a href="#stroke-category" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h2><p>The following properties control the general behavior of the brush stroke.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/hb/brushes/settings_stroke.jpg" alt="Stroke settings tab"></p>
<p>ToonSquid brushes draw their strokes by combining their <a href="/handbook/brushes/brush_settings#shape">shape</a> and <a href="/handbook/brushes/brush_settings#grain">grain</a> textures and &quot;stamping&quot; these resulting brush marks onto the layer at various points along the path that you draw with Apple Pencil or your finger.</p>
<h3 id="spacing" class="heading-with-anchor">Spacing <!-- anchor: spacing --><a href="#spacing" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>The spacing between consecutive brush marks relative to the brush size. A spacing of 100% results in neighboring brush marks touching at their edges. A spacing of 0% will place all brush marks 1px apart.</p>
<p>Lower values make the brush stroke appear smoother but also create more brush marks which can slow down the performance of the brush.</p>
<h3 id="smoothing" class="heading-with-anchor">Smoothing <!-- anchor: smoothing --><a href="#smoothing" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>Controls how much ToonSquid should attempt to remove wobbles due to shakiness in your brush strokes to create a smoother final stroke. ToonSquid will use a moving average of the most recent input positions to calculate the final inputs that will be used for the stroke.</p>
<h3 id="fall-off" class="heading-with-anchor">Fall-Off <!-- anchor: fall-off --><a href="#fall-off" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>Controls whether and how quickly the brush stroke should fade out. A value of 0% represents an infinite amount of paint that never decreases. Lower values will cause the brush to slowly run out of its selected brush color throughout the brush stroke.</p>
<h3 id="vector-mode" class="heading-with-anchor">Vector Mode <!-- anchor: vector-mode --><a href="#vector-mode" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>Enable this to turn your pixel brush into a <a href="/handbook/brushes/vector">vector brush</a>.</p>
<h3 id="vector-smoothing" class="heading-with-anchor">Vector Smoothing <!-- anchor: vector-smoothing --><a href="#vector-smoothing" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>If this brush is a <a href="/handbook/brushes/vector">vector brush</a>, the <code>Vector Smoothing</code> controls how much the final vector strokes are simplified and smoothened compared to the fully-detailed pixel brush stroke of the same brush. More smoothing results in vector strokes that are represented by fewer Bézier curves and are therefore more performant but are also not as accurate at approximating the original stroke.</p>
<h3 id="blend-mode" class="heading-with-anchor">Blend Mode <!-- anchor: blend-mode --><a href="#blend-mode" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>The <a href="/handbook/layers/blend_modes">blend mode</a> with which the brush stroke should be blended onto the existing contents of the layer. This setting is only relevant for pixel brushes.</p>
<h3 id="anti-aliasing" class="heading-with-anchor">Anti-Aliasing <!-- anchor: anti-aliasing --><a href="#anti-aliasing" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>Whether the edges of the stroke should be anti-aliased or not. Anti-aliasing will remove jagged edges from the brush strokes. Disable this if you are looking for that jagged appearance, for example when creating brushes for pixel art.</p>
<h3 id="gamma-correct-blending" class="heading-with-anchor">Gamma-Correct Blending <!-- anchor: gamma-correct-blending --><a href="#gamma-correct-blending" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>Enables gamma-correct (linear) <a href="/handbook/colors/color_spaces#brushes">blending</a> for the brush strokes, as opposed to the default sRGB blending.</p>
<h2 id="shape-category" class="heading-with-anchor">Shape <!-- anchor: shape-category --><a href="#shape-category" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h2><p>These settings control the shape of the brush marks.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/hb/brushes/settings_shape.jpg" alt="Shape settings tab"></p>
<h3 id="shape" class="heading-with-anchor">Shape Texture <!-- anchor: shape --><a href="#shape" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>The image that should be used as the shape texture of the brush. Learn more about selecting and importing brush textures <a href="/handbook/brushes/brush_textures">here</a>.</p>
<p>The shape texture is combined with the <a href="/handbook/brushes/brush_settings#grain">grain texture</a> to form the final brush marks.</p>
<h3 id="shape-inverted" class="heading-with-anchor">Inverted <!-- anchor: shape-inverted --><a href="#shape-inverted" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>Inverts the shape texture. Areas of the shape that are currently transparent will then show up in the brush stroke and currently visible portions will be invisible.</p>
<h3 id="shape-flip-x" class="heading-with-anchor">Flip X <!-- anchor: shape-flip-x --><a href="#shape-flip-x" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>Flips the shape texture horizontally.</p>
<h3 id="shape-flip-y" class="heading-with-anchor">Flip Y <!-- anchor: shape-flip-y --><a href="#shape-flip-y" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>Flips the shape texture vertically.</p>
<h2 id="grain-category" class="heading-with-anchor">Grain <!-- anchor: grain-category --><a href="#grain-category" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h2><p><img src="/assets/images/hb/brushes/settings_grain.jpg" alt="Grain settings tab"></p>
<p>In addition to the <a href="/handbook/brushes/brush_settings#shape-category">shape texture</a>, ToonSquid brushes use another texture - the so-called grain - to add more variety and detail to your brush strokes. The grain can also be used to create the effect of painting on a textured surface.</p>
<h3 id="grain" class="heading-with-anchor">Grain Texture <!-- anchor: grain --><a href="#grain" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>The image that should be used as the grain texture of the brush. Learn more about selecting and importing brush textures <a href="/handbook/brushes/brush_textures">here</a>.</p>
<p>The grain texture is combined with the <a href="/handbook/brushes/brush_settings#shape">shape texture</a> to form the final brush marks.</p>
<h3 id="grain-rendering-mode" class="heading-with-anchor">Rendering Mode <!-- anchor: grain-rendering-mode --><a href="#grain-rendering-mode" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>The grain supports two rendering modes, which define how it is combined with the shape texture to create the final brush stroke.</p>
<h4 id="grain-rendering-mode-per-stamp" class="heading-with-anchor">Per Stamp <!-- anchor: grain-rendering-mode-per-stamp --><a href="#grain-rendering-mode-per-stamp" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h4><p>The grain texture is blended with the shape texture for each brush mark (stamp) before the new mark is then added to the current stroke.</p>
<h4 id="grain-rendering-mode-per-stroke" class="heading-with-anchor">Per Stroke <!-- anchor: grain-rendering-mode-per-stroke --><a href="#grain-rendering-mode-per-stroke" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h4><p>The individual brush marks just consist of the shape texture. The grain texture is then blended with the entire brush stroke at once.</p>
<h3 id="grain-inverted" class="heading-with-anchor">Inverted <!-- anchor: grain-inverted --><a href="#grain-inverted" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>Inverts the grain texture. Areas of the Grain that are currently transparent will then show up in the brush stroke and currently visible portions will be invisible.</p>
<h3 id="grain-movement" class="heading-with-anchor">Movement <!-- anchor: grain-movement --><a href="#grain-movement" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>The grain movement defines how the grain texture is positioned when it is blended with the brush marks. A movement value of 100% causes the grain texture to match the drawing surface. As you move your brush, it will therefore blend with different parts of the grain, as if the surface is textured.</p>
<p>A value of 0% causes the entire grain texture to be blended with each brush mark, no matter where you are drawing.</p>
<p>This setting is only available if the grain rendering mode is set to <code>Per Stamp</code>.</p>
<h3 id="grain-scale" class="heading-with-anchor">Scale <!-- anchor: grain-scale --><a href="#grain-scale" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>Use this to change the scale of the grain texture.</p>
<h3 id="grain-blend-mode" class="heading-with-anchor">Blend Mode <!-- anchor: grain-blend-mode --><a href="#grain-blend-mode" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>Defines the <a href="/handbook/layers/blend_modes">blend mode</a> to be used to blend the grain and shape textures together.</p>
<p>The <code>Linear Height</code> and <code>Height</code> blend modes are unique to the grain texture and cannot be selected for layers. <code>Height</code> multiplies the shape with the <a href="/handbook/brushes/brush_settings#grain-depth">grain depth</a> before then subtracting the grain. <code>Linear Height</code> uses the same result or that of multiplying the grain instead of subtracting it, depending on which result is brighter.</p>
<blockquote>
<h4 id="tip-grain-blend-modes" class="heading-with-anchor">Tip <!-- anchor: tip-grain-blend-modes --><a href="#tip-grain-blend-modes" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h4><p>The different grain blend modes are a very powerful tool to create significantly varying brush effects using the same shape and grain textures.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="grain-brightness" class="heading-with-anchor">Brightness <!-- anchor: grain-brightness --><a href="#grain-brightness" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>You can use this setting to adjust the brightness of the grain texture before it gets blended.</p>
<h3 id="grain-contrast" class="heading-with-anchor">Contrast <!-- anchor: grain-contrast --><a href="#grain-contrast" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>You can use this setting to adjust the contrast of the grain texture before it gets blended.</p>
<h3 id="grain-depth" class="heading-with-anchor">Depth <!-- anchor: grain-depth --><a href="#grain-depth" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>The grain depth controls the intensity of the grain. If the rendering mode is set to <code>Per Stamp</code>, the grain depth can be further controlled by the following settings.</p>
<h3 id="grain-depth-jitter" class="heading-with-anchor">Jitter <!-- anchor: grain-depth-jitter --><a href="#grain-depth-jitter" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>Use this to apply a random offset to the baseline grain depth for each brush mark.</p>

Positive values increase the depth when there is more pressure, negative values decrease it with added pressure.</p>
<h3 id="grain-depth-tilt-control" class="heading-with-anchor">Tilt Control <!-- anchor: grain-depth-tilt-control --><a href="#grain-depth-tilt-control" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>Controls the grain depth based on the tilt angle of Apple Pencil.</p>
<h3 id="grain-depth-speed-control" class="heading-with-anchor">Speed Control <!-- anchor: grain-depth-speed-control --><a href="#grain-depth-speed-control" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>Controls the grain depth based on the speed at which you draw your stroke. Positive values increase the depth at higher speeds, negative values decrease it.</p>
<h2 id="scatter-category" class="heading-with-anchor">Scatter <!-- anchor: scatter-category --><a href="#scatter-category" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h2><p><img src="/assets/images/hb/brushes/settings_scatter.jpg" alt="Scatter settings tab"><br/>Use the settings in the scatter category to randomly shift the individual brush marks away from their regular position in the brush stroke.</p>
<h3 id="scatter" class="heading-with-anchor">Scatter <!-- anchor: scatter --><a href="#scatter" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>Applies a random offset to the position of every brush mark, thereby scattering them away from their original points. The slider controls how far the marks can be moved away from their original positions as a percentage of the brush size.</p>
<h3 id="scatter-all-directions" class="heading-with-anchor">All Directions <!-- anchor: scatter-all-directions --><a href="#scatter-all-directions" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>If this is enabled, the brush marks are scattered in all directions. Disable this to only shift them perpendicularly to the brush stroke.</p>
<h3 id="scatter-pressure-control" class="heading-with-anchor">Pressure Control <!-- anchor: scatter-pressure-control --><a href="#scatter-pressure-control" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>Controls the amount of scattering based on the pressure you apply with Apple Pencil during the stroke. Positive values increase the scattering with increased pressure, negative values decrease it.</p>
