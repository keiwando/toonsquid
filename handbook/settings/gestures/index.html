<h1>Gestures</h1><p>This tab contains settings regarding touch gestures in the ToonSquid editor.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/hb/settings/gestures.jpg" alt="Gesture settings"></p>
<h2 id="history" class="heading-with-anchor">History <!-- anchor: history --><a href="#history" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h2><h3>Two finger tap to undo</h3><p>Whether tapping the screen with two fingers should undo the previous edit.</p>
<h3>Three finger tap to redo</h3><p>Whether tapping the screen with three fingers should re-apply the previously undone edit.</p>
<h2 id="pipette" class="heading-with-anchor">Pipette <!-- anchor: pipette --><a href="#pipette" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Whether long pressing with a finger or Apple Pencil should temporarily switch to the <a href="/handbook/colors/pipette">pipette tool</a>. By default, only long presses with a finger cause the pipette to appear.</p>
<h2 id="page-flip" class="heading-with-anchor">Page Flip <!-- anchor: page-flip --><a href="#page-flip" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h2><p>These are settings for the <a href="/handbook/interface/gestures#page-flip">page flip</a> gesture, which allows you to flick through neighboring frames of the animation by swiping three fingers up or down on the screen.</p>
<h3 id="page-flip-enabled" class="heading-with-anchor">Three finger swipe (up / down) to flick through frames <!-- anchor: page-flip-enabled --><a href="#page-flip-enabled" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>This setting controls whether the page flip gesture should be enabled or not.</p>
<h3 id="page-flip-number" class="heading-with-anchor">Number of frames before and after to flip through <!-- anchor: page-flip-number --><a href="#page-flip-number" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>Controls the range of frames that can be reached by the flip gesture.</p>
<h3 id="page-flip-sensitivity" class="heading-with-anchor">Swipe sensitivity <!-- anchor: page-flip-sensitivity --><a href="#page-flip-sensitivity" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>A lower sensitivity requires a larger swipe distance to flip through the same number of frames than with a higher sensitivity.</p>
<h3 id="page-flip-invert" class="heading-with-anchor">Invert swipe direction <!-- anchor: page-flip-invert --><a href="#page-flip-invert" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>By default, swiping up moves backwards in the timeline and swiping down moves forwards. Toggle this option to invert that behavior.</p>
<h3 id="page-flip-reset" class="heading-with-anchor">Reset to original frame after swipe <!-- anchor: page-flip-reset --><a href="#page-flip-reset" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>If this option is enabled, the timeline will jump back to the frame that was selected before the swipe gesture began once the fingers are lifted from the screen.</p>
<h2 id="text" class="heading-with-anchor">Text <!-- anchor: text --><a href="#text" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h2><h3 id="drag-text-tool" class="heading-with-anchor">Drag in text tool <!-- anchor: drag-text-tool --><a href="#drag-text-tool" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>This setting defines whether dragging on the screen in the <a href="/handbook/text/text_editing">text tool</a> should move the selected text layer or select a range of text instead.</p>
