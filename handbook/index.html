    document.toonsquid_content = `<h1>ToonSquid</h1><p>ToonSquid is a powerful 2D art and animation studio for your iPad. No matter whether you are a beginner, hobbyist or professional, ToonSquid allows you to create stunning and high-quality animations with ease.</p>
<h2 id="handbook" class="heading-with-anchor">Handbook <!-- anchor: handbook --><a href="#handbook" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h2><p>This handbook covers every feature of ToonSquid - from the buttons in the user interface down to every single configurable brush setting. If you run into questions while using the app, the handbook should contain the answer.</p>
<p>Simply use the search field above or the chapters list on the left to quickly find the pages you are looking for.</p>
<h2 id="features" class="heading-with-anchor">Features <!-- anchor: features --><a href="#features" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h2><p>With its flexibility and large set of features, ToonSquid supports many workflows and styles of animation.</p>
<h3 id="traditional-keyframing-animation" class="heading-with-anchor">Traditional and Keyframing Animation <!-- anchor: traditional-keyframing-animation --><a href="#traditional-keyframing-animation" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>Do you want to create <a href="/handbook/layers/drawings">hand-drawn</a> frame-by-frame animations in the traditional style you know and love from cartoons and anime? Or would you rather use <a href="/handbook/keyframes/overview">keyframes</a> and let ToonSquid automatically animate property changes over time? You can also mix both styles in the same animation!</p>
<h3 id="pixel-vector-brushes" class="heading-with-anchor">Pixel and Vector Brushes <!-- anchor: pixel-vector-brushes --><a href="#pixel-vector-brushes" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>ToonSquid&#39;s high-quality and <a href="/handbook/brushes/brush_settings">fully-customizable</a> <a href="/handbook/brushes/brush_tool">brushes</a> with state-of-the-art performance make full use of Apple Pencil and the iPad Pro&#39;s 120Hz display to deliver gorgeous brush stroke effects. They support pixel art, wet mixing, inking, sketching and many more styles of painting. The <a href="/handbook/brushes/vector">vector brush</a> mode allows you to paint vector shapes that look perfectly sharp at every zoom level.</p>
<h3 id="symbols" class="heading-with-anchor">Symbols <!-- anchor: symbols --><a href="#symbols" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>Create <a href="/handbook/symbols/symbol_layer">symbols</a> and reuse <a href="/handbook/symbols/animation_clips">animations</a>. Any change you make to the referenced animation immediately shows up in all of its symbols.</p>
<h3 id="text" class="heading-with-anchor">Text <!-- anchor: text --><a href="#text" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>Add <a href="/handbook/text/overview">text layers</a>, import custom <a href="/handbook/text/fonts">fonts</a> and animate the <a href="/handbook/text/text_layer">text appearance</a>. ToonSquid also supports <a href="/handbook/text/text_editing#rtl">bidirectional text</a> and <a href="/handbook/text/text_editing#ime">IMEs</a> for non-Latin-based languages.</p>
<h3 id="vector-shapes" class="heading-with-anchor">Vector Shapes <!-- anchor: vector-shapes --><a href="#vector-shapes" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p><a href="/handbook/path/path_layer">Path layers</a> let you create vector shapes, add <a href="/handbook/colors/gradients">gradients</a> and create dynamic <a href="/handbook/path/path_layer#trim">path trimming</a> animations. Quickly add shapes from the <a href="/handbook/path/shape_library">shape library</a> and customize them or create your own with the <a href="/handbook/path/path_tool">path tool</a> that gives you full control over every control point.</p>
<h3 id="color" class="heading-with-anchor">Color <!-- anchor: color --><a href="#color" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>ToonSquid&#39;s powerful <a href="/handbook/colors/color_picker">color picker</a> provides plenty of options to choose the exact colors you want to work with. Create custom <a href="/handbook/colors/color_palettes">color palettes</a> to speed up your workflow. You can even <a href="/handbook/colors/color_palettes#share">share</a> them with others.</p>
<h3 id="camera" class="heading-with-anchor">Camera <!-- anchor: camera --><a href="#camera" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>Add a <a href="/handbook/layers/camera">camera layer</a> to define which areas of the animation should be visible in the export. The camera can also be animated to simplify the creation of general movement in your scene.</p>
<h3 id="transform" class="heading-with-anchor">Transform <!-- anchor: transform --><a href="#transform" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>Every layer&#39;s <a href="/handbook/transform/transform_properties">position, rotation and scale</a> can be animated. Additionally, <a href="/handbook/transform/transform_layer">transform layers</a> and the <a href="/handbook/transform/hierarchy">transform hierarchy</a> make it possible to define more advanced movement and simulate character rigs.</p>
<h3 id="audio-video" class="heading-with-anchor">Audio and Video <!-- anchor: audio-video --><a href="#audio-video" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>Of course, you can also add <a href="/handbook/layers/video">videos</a> and <a href="/handbook/layers/audio">audio clips</a> to your animation to perform lip-syncing and finish your animation all in one place without the need for another editor.</p>
<h3 id="export" class="heading-with-anchor">Export <!-- anchor: export --><a href="#export" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>Once you are happy with your work, ToonSquid lets you <a href="/handbook/export/overview">export</a> and share it in a variety of widely-used formats. Create MP4 <a href="/handbook/export/video">videos</a>, <a href="/handbook/export/gif">GIFs</a> or export individual frames of your animation as still <a href="/handbook/export/image">images</a>.</p>
